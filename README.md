# ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Attendance management system deals with the maintenance of the studentâ€™s attendance details.
It generates the attendance of the student on the basis of presence in class. It is maintained on the
daily basis of their attendance. The students and staff will be provided with the separate username &
password to login. The staff handling the particular subjects are responsible to make the attendance
for all students. Only if the student presents on that particular period, the attendance will be
calculated. and according to the calculated attendance, the eligibility of the student to attend the
exams will be calculated.



## Introduction
Attendance Management System is the software which helps in storing the
information about the attendance of the students in an institution. Instead of
performing the work using pen and paper as in olden days, we prefer to do it in the
computerized way using this software. This makes the system easy to handle and
get the information required at any point of time. It is very efficient since we can
do this work in a very short period of time whereas the older version of the
registration that is using pen and paper takes a long period of time and will not be
able to be preserved for a long period of time. It includes the process of marking
the attendance of students attending the respective courses that they are
registered to and creating a report on which student is eligible to attend the exams
on the basis of attendance. It is easy to handle and user friendly so that it can be
used by anybody. As the number of students increases in the institute, manually
managing the strength becomes a hectic job for the administrator. This
computerized system stores all the data in the database which makes it easy to
fetch and update whenever needed.
As the older system is outdated now which uses paper, pen and files which will
require the human work to maintain them. This system reduces the cost of the
workforce required for this job. As the system is online the information will be
globally available to everyone.
